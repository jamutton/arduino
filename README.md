# Arduino Projects
This is simply a collection of random Arduino projects for various home
automation/private-cloud ideas.  I'm toying with sensors, events and other various
control channels that don't get caught up in all the IoT hoopla.

All projects are licensed MIT unless otherwise noted.  Libraries are omitted but should be obvious what you need.

### CarScreens
A menu control system for custom automotive controls.  Uses a TFT Touch screen and some rotary encoders in the stock radio position in my 67 Mustang as a UI to send digital signals to other car systems.

### Display
Part of the new dashboard project in the 67 Mustang.  Integrating some small OLED displays into the speedo/tach for display of various running parameters and sensor inputs as well as a gear indicator (for replacing the shifter with something more streamlined).

### IRSender/decoder
I had to figure out the mark/space setup of a HDMI switch for automating changing between inputs.  This was my discovery tool and output sample controls for an IR LED.

### gasDetect
Just playing around with a gas sensor that is supposed to pickup CO, ammonia, methane/propane/CNG and other nastys

### tempMonitor
Another small sensor setup for measuring temperature.  Ideally, something that can be eventually integrated on the WiFi for eventing the temp in various rooms.
